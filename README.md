> **Local-first metabolic health tracking engineered with clean architecture and strict privacy guarantees.**

**Glucosa** is an offline-first diabetes and metabolic health tracking platform built with **Flutter**, **Riverpod 3.x**, **Isar Community**, and **Material 3**. Designed for individuals managing diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational, LADA), Glucosa delivers multi-metric health tracking, trend analysis, clinical calculators, recurring reminders, calendar overview, device health integrations, and complete data export capabilities.

## 💡 Why Glucosa? Architectural Motivation

> *"Most glucose tracking apps either lock health data into a proprietary cloud account or focus solely on basic logging. Glucosa demonstrates what a privacy-preserving, local-first metabolic health tracker looks like when engineered with clean architecture."*

Every technical choice in Glucosa is deliberate and rooted in clinical reliability and data sovereignty:

- **Isar Database isn't just an arbitrary database choice** — it is the foundation of a **local-first** reactive architecture. Health readings are persisted instantly with zero network latency, querying is sub-millisecond, and reactive watchers stream database updates directly into UI state.
- **CSV Export & Import as the Authoritative Backup Pathway** — with Android cloud auto-backup explicitly disabled (`allowBackup="false"`), health records remain on-device; complete CSV export and import guarantee the user always owns and can migrate their health data without vendor silos.
- **Biometric Security & Sandboxing** — sensitive health records remain protected behind Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint, or system PIN authentication within the local application sandbox.
- **Structured Observability** — logging (`AppLogger`), global provider lifecycle observers (`AppProviderObserver`), and rotating on-device crash logs (`AppCrashReporter`) provide diagnostics without leaking user data.

## 💎 What Glucosa Demonstrates

Glucosa demonstrates production-ready mobile engineering across key software architecture dimensions:

| Dimension | Engineering Focus in Glucosa |
|---|---|
| **State Management** | **Riverpod 3.x** code generation (`@riverpod`), stream-driven notifiers, and automatic provider disposal |
| **Clinical Domain** | Value objects, ADA / AACE / UK NICE clinical guidelines, AHA blood pressure stages (Normal, Elevated, High, Crisis), and ketone risk stratification |
| **Complex Reactive State** | Unified multi-metric aggregation (glucose, HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, ketones, weight) |
| **Data Visualization** | Interactive time-series charts via `fl_chart`, day/week/month bucketing, and dynamic target range boundary lines |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Local-first persistence, biometric app lock, on-device diagnostic logs, and complete CSV export/import |
| **Clean Architecture** | Feature-first modular package structure, strict inward dependency rules, and zero data-model leakage to presentation |

- **HbA1c**: Record laboratory glycated hemoglobin in **%** or **mmol/mol**.
- **Blood Pressure**: Monitor systolic and diastolic pressures (mmHg) with clinical status indicators (Normal, Elevated, High, Crisis).
- **Ketones**: Track blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (mmol/L) with clinical warnings (Normal, Elevated, High).
- **Cholesterol**: Record Total, LDL, and HDL lipid profiles (mg/dL).
- **Weight**: Track body weight in **kg** or **lbs**.

### 📈 Interactive Charts & Clinical Insights
- **Trend Charts**: Interactive `fl_chart` time-series visualization with flexible aggregation (**Day**, **Week**, **Month**).
- **Target Range Bounds**: Visual upper and lower target lines on charts based on personalized target ranges.
- **Estimated HbA1c (eA1c)**: Calculated dynamically using the ADAG formula based on a 90-day glucose reading average (minimum 3 readings).

- **Interactive Calendar**: Monthly calendar overview with day-level inspection, month navigation, and quick entry shortcuts.
- **Habits & Milestones**: Habit tracking, logging streaks, milestone badges, and clinical visit summaries.

### 🛠 Tools & Platform Integrations
- **HbA1c Calculator**: Standalone utility screen offering bidirectional estimation between average glucose and HbA1c with direct reading persistence.
- **Scheduled Reminders**: Local notification reminders for medication, blood glucose checks, and lifestyle logging with customizable recurring schedules.
- **Health Platform Sync**: Native integration with **Apple HealthKit** (iOS) and **Google Health Connect** (Android) for syncing blood glucose, blood pressure, ketones, and weight.
- **Biometric Security**: App lock protection supported by biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint) or system PIN with configurable auto-lock timeout.
- **Home Screen Widgets**: Quick-glance glucose monitoring supported via Android AppWidgets.
- **CSV Data Export**: Filter readings by metric and date range, generating standard CSV files shareable directly via the native system share sheet.

### ⚙️ Personalization & Clinical Settings
- **Target Range Profiles**: Select clinical presets (**ADA**, **AACE**, **UK NICE**) or configure custom minimum/maximum glucose thresholds.
- **Diabetes Profiles**: Tailored tracking for **Type 1**, **Type 2**, **Gestational**, and **LADA**.
- **Appearance**: Seamless switching between System, Light, and Dark themes with Material 3 styling.

## 🤖 Engineering Standards & Agentic Coding Workflow

Glucosa is engineered as a production reference combining senior architectural discipline with modern agentic workflows (governed by `AGENTS.md` and `agents_project.md`):

- **Strict Invariant Guardrails**: Universal standards in `AGENTS.md` enforce clean architectural layer isolation, zero defensive fallbacks, and complete resource disposal across platforms.
- **Mandatory Verification Pipeline**: Every change is validated through automated static analysis, `custom_lint` rules, formatting, and unit/widget test suites.
- **Pure Domain Boundaries**: The core domain layer contains zero UI, Flutter, or database imports, ensuring clinical logic (ADA thresholds, ADAG formulas, unit converters) remains completely portable and testable.

### Clinical Formulas & Guidelines
- **Estimated HbA1c (eA1c):** Calculated using the clinically validated A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study formula:
  $$\text{eA1c } [\%] = \frac{\text{Average Glucose } [\text{mg/dL}] + 46.7}{28.7}$$
