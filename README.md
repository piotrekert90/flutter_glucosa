> **Local-first metabolic health tracking built with Flutter, Riverpod, and on-device storage.**

**Glucosa** is an offline-first diabetes and metabolic health tracking application built with **Flutter**, **Riverpod 3.x**, **Isar Community**, and **Material 3**. Designed for individuals managing diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational, LADA), Glucosa provides multi-metric tracking, trend analysis, clinical calculators, recurring reminders, calendar overview, device health integrations, and CSV data export/import.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Principles

The technical design focuses on clinical reliability and data privacy:

- **Local-first storage** — Health data remains on-device in an Isar database unless you explicitly export or sync it through a platform integration.
- **Data portability** — With Android cloud backup explicitly disabled (`allowBackup="false"`), complete CSV export and import serve as the primary path for backups and migration.
- **Biometric security** — Optional app lock using device biometrics (Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint) or system PIN.
- **Operational diagnostics** — Crash and usage telemetry may be sent to Firebase for reliability and debugging, while raw health readings stay on-device by default.

| Dimension | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **State Management** | **Riverpod 3.x** code generation (`@riverpod`), stream-driven notifiers, and automatic provider disposal |
| **Clinical Domain** | Value objects, ADA / AACE / UK NICE clinical guidelines, AHA blood pressure stages (Normal, Elevated, High, Crisis), and ketone risk stratification |
| **Reactive State** | Unified multi-metric aggregation (glucose, HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, ketones, weight) |
| **Data Visualization** | Interactive time-series charts via `fl_chart`, day/week/month bucketing, and dynamic target range boundary lines |
| **Data Privacy** | Local-first persistence, biometric app lock, explicit export/sync control, and limited Firebase diagnostics for app reliability |
| **Clean Architecture** | Feature-first modular package structure, strict inward dependency rules, and domain layer isolated from UI and database |

## 🎯 Core Features

### 📊 Multi-Metric Health Tracking
- **Blood Glucose**: Log readings with rich clinical meal context (Fasting, Before/After Breakfast, Before/After Lunch, Before/After Dinner, Snack, Bedtime, Night, Recheck, Other). Automatic conversion and display in **mg/dL** or **mmol/L**.
- **HbA1c**: Record laboratory glycated hemoglobin in **%** or **mmol/mol**.
- **Blood Pressure**: Monitor systolic and diastolic pressures (mmHg) with clinical status indicators (Normal, Elevated, High, Crisis).
- **Ketones**: Track blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (mmol/L) with clinical warnings (Normal, Elevated, High).
- **Cholesterol**: Record Total, LDL, and HDL lipid profiles (mg/dL).
- **Weight**: Track body weight in **kg** or **lbs**.

### 📈 Interactive Charts & Clinical Insights
- **Trend Charts**: Interactive `fl_chart` time-series visualization with flexible aggregation (**Day**, **Week**, **Month**).
- **Target Range Bounds**: Visual upper and lower target lines on charts based on personalized target ranges.
- **Estimated HbA1c (eA1c)**: Calculated dynamically using the ADAG formula based on a 90-day glucose reading average (minimum 3 readings).
- **Unified History Feed**: Chronological stream of all health metrics with filter chips, swipe-to-delete, and instant undo actions.
- **Interactive Calendar**: Monthly calendar overview with day-level inspection, month navigation, and quick entry shortcuts.
- **Habits & Milestones**: Habit tracking, logging streaks, milestone badges, and clinical visit summaries.

### 🛠 Tools & Platform Integrations
- **HbA1c Calculator**: Standalone utility screen offering bidirectional estimation between average glucose and HbA1c with direct reading persistence.
- **Scheduled Reminders**: Local notification reminders for medication, blood glucose checks, and lifestyle logging with customizable recurring schedules. On Android, reminders use inexact scheduling by default (an exact alarm is used only when the system permits it), so delivery can slip by a few minutes under battery optimization.
- **Health Platform Sync**: Native integration with **Apple HealthKit** (iOS) and **Google Health Connect** (Android) for syncing blood glucose, blood pressure, ketones, and weight.
- **Biometric Security**: App lock protection supported by biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint) or system PIN with configurable auto-lock timeout.
- **Home Screen Widgets**: Quick-glance glucose monitoring supported via Android AppWidgets.
- **CSV Data Export**: Filter readings by metric and date range, generating standard CSV files shareable directly via the native system share sheet.

### ⚙️ Personalization & Clinical Settings
- **Target Range Profiles**: Select clinical presets (**ADA**, **AACE**, **UK NICE**) or configure custom minimum/maximum glucose thresholds.
- **Diabetes Profiles**: Tailored tracking for **Type 1**, **Type 2**, **Gestational**, and **LADA**.
- **Appearance**: Seamless switching between System, Light, and Dark themes with Material 3 styling.
