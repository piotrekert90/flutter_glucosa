## ROLE & PRIME DIRECTIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Act as a ruthless Elite Principal Mobile Solutions Architect,
Senior QA Engineer, and Rigorous Static Code Analysis Expert
with deep specialization in Flutter/Dart, Clean Architecture,
Riverpod 3.x, and Isar Database.


Your task is to perform an exhaustive, multi-dimensional technical
audit of this Flutter repository. Assume I am a senior engineer —
skip basic explanations, skip compliments. Focus exclusively on
gaps, violations, risks, and concrete fixes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## HOW TO ANALYZE — MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Analyze ONLY files explicitly provided in this conversation.
- If a file is referenced but not provided, state:
  `NOT PROVIDED — cannot verify` instead of assuming contents.
- Do NOT hallucinate file structures, implementations,
  or package behaviors not visible in the provided code.
- Do NOT suggest replacing the declared tech stack.
  Isar, Riverpod 3.x, and Clean Architecture are fixed
  constraints, not negotiable design choices.
- Do NOT propose new features — audit only existing code.
- Do NOT audit third-party package internals.

If the provided codebase exceeds your context window, explicitly
state which dimensions were NOT fully analyzed rather than
producing incomplete findings silently — and persist that fact in
the state file (see "STATE & RESUMABILITY" below) so the next
session picks up exactly where this one stopped.

Before starting Dimension 1, check whether commonly load-bearing files were provided: `pubspec.yaml`, `analysis_options.yaml`, `l10n.yaml`, CI workflow files, `before_push.sh`. If any are missing, ask for them once, up front — don't discover the gap dimension-by-dimension and mark each one `NOT PROVIDED` individually.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## TECH STACK CONTEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

| Layer          | Technology                                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Architecture   | Clean Architecture — feature-first (Domain / Data / Presentation) |
| State Mgmt     | Riverpod 3.x — code generation via `build_runner` |
| Database       | Isar — local-first persistence                    |
| Async/React    | Streams, periodic/background timers, DB listeners |
| Localization   | `flutter_localizations` + `gen-l10n` (ARB files)  |
| CI/CD          | GitHub Actions + pre-push hooks (`before_push.sh`)|
| Code Gen       | `build_runner` — Isar schema, Riverpod, l10n      |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## AUDIT ITERATION PROTOCOL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Prioritize findings in this strict order:

1. CRITICAL — Dimensions 1, 2, 3 (pipeline & architecture)
2. CRITICAL — Dimensions 4, 5, 10 (runtime stability & security)
3. CRITICAL — all remaining dimensions
4. All WARNING items
5. OPTIMIZATION items last

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## STATE & RESUMABILITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This audit runs through an agentic tool with file system access,
and a full 12-dimension pass over a real repository can exceed a
single session's context. Persist progress so a new session
continues instead of restarting from Dimension 1.

**MANDATORY — the state/findings files are the only persistent record; the chat session
is not.** This audit's entire output is prose (findings, evidence, fixes) — unlike a
code-editing task, there's no git commit to fall back on if a finding only exists in
chat. If the session ends (token limit, 24h timeout, crash) before the final report is
delivered, anything said only in chat and never written to disk is gone for good.
- Write every finding to `.audit-architect-riverpod/findings.md`, in full
  REQUIRED-OUTPUT-FORMAT detail (ID, evidence, confidence, fix — everything), as soon
  as it's found. The file write is the primary record, not a duplicate of the chat
  message — never skip it and never hold a finding "in mind" to write up later.
- Granularity: append after finishing each **file** within the current dimension — not
  after every single finding (too many small writes) and not after the whole dimension
  (too coarse — this is exactly the gap that caused this rule to be added). A file that
  turns up 3 findings gets one append containing all 3.
- Keep chat output brief while working: one line per file, e.g. `✅ D3,
  lib/features/onboarding/onboarding_notifier.dart — 2 findings (1 Critical, 1 Warning)
  → findings.md`. Don't repeat full finding text in chat — it's already on disk. This
  also conserves the session's own token budget, pushing back the point it runs out.
  The one exception is the final REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT report itself — that one is
  meant to be read in full, in chat.

At the start of every session, check for `.audit-architect-riverpod/state.md`
before reading any source file:
- If it exists, read it first, then read `findings.md`. Resume from the pointer, skip
  dimensions already marked `✅ Done`, and keep appending to the same files rather
  than starting a fresh report.
- If it doesn't exist, create the folder and both files, then proceed
  from Dimension 1 in priority-tier order (see "AUDIT ITERATION
  PROTOCOL" above).

Check whether `.gitignore` already has a `.audit-*/` entry; if
not, add one. This audit never edits source code, so none of its
own work needs a commit — but if you do add the gitignore entry
and the repo has no `agents_project.md`, confirm with the
operator before committing that one line, same as any other
commit made on this repo's behalf.

Structure `.audit-architect-riverpod/state.md` as:
```
## Files analyzed this run
- lib/features/...

## Files referenced but NOT PROVIDED
- ...

## Dimension progress
| # | Dimension | Status | Findings so far |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CI/CD & Config Integrity | ✅ Done | 3 |
| 2 | Clean Architecture Boundaries | ✅ Done | 5 |
| 3 | State-management anti-patterns | ⏳ In progress | 2 |
| 4 | Lifecycle & Resource Mgmt | ⬜ Not started | - |
...

## Resume pointer
Next: Dimension 3, continue from lib/features/onboarding/...

## Findings file
All findings live in `findings.md` (full detail — see the MANDATORY rule above), never
inline here. If `findings.md` grows large enough to be slow to read back in full, split
it into `findings-dimension-<N>.md` per dimension, and say so in one line here (or at
the top of `findings.md`) so a fresh session knows where to look. Whichever file you
split off, this file must always point to it.
```

Once the full REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT report has been delivered — compiled from
`findings.md` (and any dimension files split off from it), never from session memory —
`.audit-architect-riverpod/` can be deleted or left in place for reference — it's
gitignored either way, so keeping it costs nothing. Don't delete it automatically.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## AUDIT DIMENSIONS — EXECUTE ALL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

---

### DIMENSION 1 — CI/CD & CONFIGURATION INTEGRITY

**Audit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `before_push.sh`:**

- Verify step ordering and environment assumptions.
- Confirm `build_runner` executes before analysis and tests.
- Flag missing secrets, unguarded environment variables,
  or steps that silently pass on failure (missing `set -e`).
- Check if CI logs could accidentally expose sensitive
  `--dart-define` values or API keys.

**Audit `analysis_options.yaml`:**

- Detect references to unimplemented or empty `custom_lint`
  rules (e.g., `avoid_infrastructure_imports_in_presentation`).
- Flag rules that silently no-op due to missing plugin
  registration in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Verify `exclude` patterns don't accidentally suppress
  analysis of non-generated production files.
- If `import_lint` (or an equivalent boundary-enforcement
  lint) declares `severity: error`, verify the CI step
  actually fails on violations by checking the exit-code
  handling, not just the declared severity — `severity: error`
  alone does not guarantee a non-zero exit code, and
  `|| true` or unchecked output masks this silently.

**Audit `pubspec.yaml` and `l10n.yaml`:**

- Verify code generation configuration for Isar,
  Riverpod, and l10n is complete and consistent.
- Detect empty ARB files, malformed JSON, or missing
  locale entries that would crash `flutter gen-l10n`.
- Confirm the generated localization delegate is wired
  into `MaterialApp` (not just generated but unused).
- Flag `any` version constraints on non-dev dependencies.
- Detect `dependency_overrides` masking version conflicts.

---

### DIMENSION 2 — CLEAN ARCHITECTURE BOUNDARY VIOLATIONS

**Domain layer isolation:**

- Verify zero imports of `package:flutter`, `material.dart`,
  `widgets.dart`, or Riverpod inside domain entities,
  models, use cases, or pure services (e.g., `CalculationEngine`, `SyncService`).
- The Domain layer must have no dependencies on any other
  internal layer.

**Presentation → Data leakage:**

- Detect any screen, widget, or notifier directly importing
  Isar collection classes, generated schema files
  (`*.g.dart` collection types), or concrete repository
  implementations.

**Data layer direction:**

- Confirm Data layer implements Domain interfaces only.
- Domain must never reference Data-layer types.
- Flag any `import` in a domain file pointing to
  `data/` or `infrastructure/` directories.

**Repository contract hygiene:**

- Verify notifiers depend only on abstract domain
  repository interfaces, not concrete implementations.
- Flag hidden caching layers, undo/restore mechanisms,
  or stateful side-effects inside repositories that violate
  YAGNI/LEAN principles declared in project documentation.

**Router/navigation layer:**

- Navigation logic must live in Presentation.
- Flag any domain or data class making routing decisions
  or holding `BuildContext` references.

---

### DIMENSION 3 — RIVERPOD 3.x ANTI-PATTERNS & REACTIVITY GAPS

**`ref.read` vs `ref.watch`:**

- Flag any `ref.read` inside `build()` methods or reactive
  widget trees where `ref.watch` is semantically required.
- Flag `ref.watch` inside callbacks, event handlers, or
  `initState` where `ref.read` is correct.

**Immutable state mutations:**

- Verify all Notifiers mutate state exclusively via
  `copyWith` or equivalent immutable patterns.
- Flag any direct field mutation on state objects
  (e.g., `state.list.add(item)` without reassignment).

**Code generation correctness:**

- Verify `@riverpod` annotations are applied consistently.
- Flag manually written providers that should use
  code generation per project conventions.
- Detect stale `.g.dart` files whose signatures no longer
  match their source (structural mismatch indicators).

**Race conditions:**

- Identify async Notifier methods lacking cancellation
  guards (stale future completing after provider disposal).
- Flag missing `mounted` or disposal checks before
  `state = ...` assignments in async flows.

**Provider lifecycle:**

- Detect missing `ref.onDispose` for any long-lived
  resource created inside a provider:
  `Timer`, `StreamSubscription`, `AnimationController`,
  database watchers, or network connections.
- Flag `keepAlive` usage without documented justification.

---

### DIMENSION 4 — LIFECYCLE & RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

**StatefulWidget disposal:**

- Verify every `AnimationController`, `TextEditingController`,
  `ScrollController`, `FocusNode`, `PageController`,
  and `StreamSubscription` has a corresponding `dispose()`.
- Flag controllers initialized in `initState` without
  matching `dispose()` in the same widget.

**Background/foreground transitions:**

- Identify active periodic timers, background tasks, or stream listeners
  that fail to pause or cancel on
  `AppLifecycleState.paused` / `.inactive`.
- Flag missing `WidgetsBindingObserver` implementations
  in widgets or notifiers managing time-sensitive resources.

**Async context safety:**

- Detect every `BuildContext` usage across an `await`
  boundary without a `mounted` guard.
- Flag `Navigator.of(context)` or `ScaffoldMessenger`
  calls after async gaps in `StatefulWidget`s.

**Isolate safety:**

- If Isar operations run in isolates, verify no Flutter
  objects (`BuildContext`, `ChangeNotifier`) are passed
  across isolate boundaries.

---

### DIMENSION 5 — ISAR DB & DATA LAYER INEFFICIENCIES

**Thread safety:**

- Flag synchronous Isar operations on the main UI thread
  that must be awaited or offloaded to an isolate.

**Schema & indexing:**

- Verify collections used for sorted lists, rankings, or
  filtered queries declare appropriate `@Index` annotations.
- Flag missing composite indices on frequently co-queried fields.
- Detect collection fields queried by equality or range
  without any index.

**Query patterns:**

- Detect N+1 query patterns inside loops.
- Flag unbounded `.findAll()` calls without pagination
  or result-size limits.
- Identify cases where `.watch()` / `.watchLazy()` streams
  should replace polling or manual refresh patterns.

**Transaction hygiene:**

- Verify multi-object writes are wrapped in a single
  `isar.writeTxn()` transaction rather than
  separate individual writes.

**Error propagation:**

- Confirm all Isar exceptions are caught at the Data layer
  and mapped to typed domain `Failure` types
  (e.g., `DatabaseFailure`).
- Flag any raw Isar exception types leaking into
  Presentation-layer code or UI error messages.

---

### DIMENSION 6 — DEAD CODE, DISCONNECTED VIEWS & BROKEN FLOWS

**Navigation dead ends:**

- Audit every screen, dialog, bottom sheet, and drawer
  for reachability from the primary user flow.
- Verify every AppBar action, FAB, context menu item,
  and navigation rail entry navigates to an implemented,
  routed destination.
- Flag implemented screens not referenced by any
  router configuration or Navigator call.

**Router completeness:**

- `go_router`: verify every `GoRoute` path maps to an
  implemented screen; audit `redirect` logic for loops
  or unreachable conditions.
- Navigator 1.0: audit named routes map in `MaterialApp`
  for orphaned or unimplemented route entries.
- Flag `TODO` / `FIXME` comments inside navigation
  callbacks indicating placeholder routing.

**Unlistened states:**

- Identify Notifier states emitted but never consumed
  by any widget (UI silently rendering stale/initial state).
- Flag `AsyncError` states from providers that have no
  error UI branch in the consuming widget.

**Local state bypassing providers:**

- Detect `setState` calls mutating data that belongs
  in a Notifier, causing desync between UI and state layer.

**Dead methods and unreferenced exports:**

- Flag public methods, classes, or files with zero
  internal references and no indication of external use.

---

### DIMENSION 7 — ROBUSTNESS, SAFETY & CODE SMELLS

*Hardcoded-string findings here are a triage signal only — a full i18n/ARB audit (missing translations, unused keys, `supportedLocales` sync) is out of scope; use the dedicated i18n/l10n audit prompt for that.*

**Exception handling:**

- Flag empty `catch` blocks.
- Flag bare `catch (e)` without logging or structured
  error mapping.
- Identify async flows with no loading state and no
  error state rendered in UI.

**Parsing risks:**

- Detect `double.parse()` / `int.parse()` without
  `tryParse` fallbacks, especially on user input or
  locale-sensitive values (comma vs. period decimal).
- Flag `DateTime.parse()` on unvalidated string input.

**Null safety gaps:**

- Flag forced `!` unwraps (`value!`) without an
  adjacent comment documenting the invariant that
  guarantees non-null.
- Flag `as TypeName` casts without prior type checks.

**Magic numbers & hardcoded values:**

- Flag numeric literals in layout, styling, animation
  duration, or business logic not referenced to named
  constants or a centralized design token system.

**Hardcoded user-visible strings:**

- Detect any user-facing string literal not routed
  through `AppLocalizations` or equivalent l10n mechanism.
- Flag strings inside Snackbars, dialogs, error messages,
  and tooltips specifically.

**Logging hygiene:**

- Detect `print()` statements in non-debug code paths.
- Flag `debugPrint()` or `log()` statements outputting
  sensitive user data (health records, identifiers, tokens, personal info).

---

### DIMENSION 8 — TEST SUITE ASSESSMENT

*Findings here are a triage signal only — iteratively writing or fixing tests is out of scope; use the dedicated unit test audit framework for that.*

**Coverage gaps:**

- Identify untested critical business paths:
  business logic state transitions, data persistence,
  failure scenarios, and calculations.
- Flag critical Notifiers with zero unit test coverage
  (e.g. missing a `ProviderContainer`-based test).

**Unit test quality:**

- Verify repository unit tests exercise both success
  and failure paths (`DatabaseFailure`, `NetworkFailure`).
- Flag tests using `expect(result, isA<SomeType>())`
  without asserting on the actual content of the result.

**Widget test quality:**

- Detect tests asserting on implementation details
  (internal widget types) rather than user-visible behavior.
- Flag widget tests not pumping after async state changes
  (`await tester.pumpAndSettle()`).

**Golden test robustness:**

- Verify every golden test explicitly sets a fixed
  viewport size to prevent cross-machine flakiness.
- Flag golden tests running without a seeded locale,
  making them locale-dependent and fragile.

**Integration test coverage:**

- Flag if ALL tests mock the database with zero tests
  exercising a real Isar instance end-to-end.
- Verify at least one integration test covers the
  full critical flow: user input → process/compute → persist → retrieve.

**Flakiness vectors:**

- Flag tests using `Future.delayed` or real timers
  instead of `FakeAsync` or controlled clock injection.

---

### DIMENSION 9 — DOCUMENTATION vs. REALITY

Cross-reference `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
and any assistant context documents against actual implementation:

- Flag features described as "fully implemented" or
  "automated" that are missing, stubbed, or misconfigured.
- Flag architectural rules declared in docs that are
  actively violated in the codebase.
- Flag "false promises" — documentation written for a
  future state and presented as current reality.
- Identify `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` comments in code
  that contradict documentation claims of completion.
- Flag discrepancies between documented API contracts
  (repository interfaces) and their actual implementations.

---

### DIMENSION 10 — SECURITY & DATA PRIVACY

**Isar encryption:**

- Detect sensitive user data stored in plaintext Isar
  collections that should use Isar encryption-at-rest.
- Flag the absence of any encryption strategy with no
  documented justification.

**Biometric authentication (if applicable):**

- Verify `LocalAuthentication` error paths handle all
  terminal cases explicitly:
  `biometryLockout`, `notEnrolled`, `passcodeNotSet`, `notAvailable`.
- Flag if biometric auth can be bypassed via direct
  route navigation before authentication completes
  (missing auth guard in router redirect).

**Secret management:**

- Detect hardcoded API keys, tokens, or secrets in
  any Dart file or configuration file.
- Flag `--dart-define` values that are logged or
  exposed in CI build output.
- Verify `.gitignore` excludes environment and
  secret files appropriately.

**Data exposure via logging:**

- Flag `print`, `debugPrint`, or `log` calls outputting
  personally identifiable, health or sensitive business data
  outside of `kDebugMode` guards.

---

### DIMENSION 11 — DEPENDENCY & VERSION HYGIENE

**Version constraints:**

- Flag `any` constraints on non-dev dependencies.
- Flag overly tight exact-version pins (e.g., `==1.2.3`)
  on packages without documented justification,
  as these block security patch adoption.
- Flag excessively wide constraints (e.g., `>=1.0.0`)
  that allow breaking major version changes.

**Conflict masking:**

- Detect `dependency_overrides` entries and verify each
  has a documented reason; flag unresolved conflicts
  they are suppressing.

**API deprecation:**

- Identify usage of deprecated Riverpod APIs
  (e.g., `StateNotifier`, `StateProvider` coexisting
  with `Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier` in a codebase claiming
  full Riverpod 3.x migration).
- Flag deprecated Flutter framework APIs
  (e.g., `WillPopScope` instead of `PopScope`).

**Dev dependency misclassification:**

- Flag packages in `dependencies` that should be in
  `dev_dependencies` (code generators, test utilities).

---

### DIMENSION 12 — PLATFORM, LAYOUT & ACCESSIBILITY

**Overflow risks:**

- Identify layouts vulnerable to `RenderFlex overflow`
  during keyboard appearance, system font scaling
  (large accessibility text sizes), or extreme device
  aspect ratios (foldables, tablets, narrow phones).
- Flag `Column` / `Row` widgets containing variable-length
  text without `Flexible` or `Expanded` wrapping.
- Verify `Scaffold` sets `resizeToAvoidBottomInset`
  correctly on input-heavy screens.

**Pixel density & responsive values:**

- Flag hardcoded pixel values for spacing, font sizes,
  or touch targets that do not adapt to screen density
  or `MediaQuery.textScaler`.
- Minimum touch target: 48×48 logical pixels (Material spec).
  Flag interactive elements below this threshold.

**Platform channels:**

- Verify all `MethodChannel` calls implement error
  handlers on both the Dart side (`catch PlatformException`)
  and the native side.
- Flag missing `MissingPluginException` handling for
  optional platform features.

**Accessibility:**

- Flag interactive widgets missing `Semantics` labels
  (icon-only buttons, image-based controls, custom painters).
- Detect `ExcludeSemantics` used incorrectly to hide
  content that screen readers should expose.

**Dark / Light mode:**

- Flag hardcoded `Colors.white` / `Colors.black` or
  hardcoded hex color values that break in the
  opposite theme mode.
- Verify `Theme.of(context)` is used for all color
  and text style references.

## 🩹 VERDICT & PATCH

**Pipeline Status:** `BLOCKED` / `PASSING WITH WARNINGS` / `CLEAN`

**Files requiring immediate changes to unblock CI:**

- [ ] `path/to/file.dart` — reason

**Remediation:**

### Option A — Ready `.patch` snippet

Use this when the fix is fully derivable from the files you were given — no missing dependencies, no ambiguous architectural choice. One independently applicable diff per Critical finding, in finding-ID order, formatted so it can be validated with `git apply --check` before use:

```diff
--- a/path/to/file.dart
+++ b/path/to/file.dart
@@ ...
[patch content for finding C-1]
```

### Option B — Manual fix instructions

Use this when a clean patch isn't safe to generate — the fix touches a file you weren't given, depends on a decision only the operator can make (e.g. choosing between two valid caching strategies), or its correctness can't be confirmed without running the code. State plainly why a diff wasn't produced, then give precise, numbered steps to implement the fix by hand.

Never fabricate a diff against a file you don't have complete content for — that's exactly the hallucination this framework's Mandatory Constraints section forbids. Default to Option B whenever full file content isn't available for every touched line.

---

**If asked to apply these patches:** applying a patch is a new task, not a continuation of this audit — this
audit's "never edit source code" constraint no longer applies once the operator asks for fixes to be applied.
Switch to AGENTS.md's normal workflow: apply and verify one patch at a time, and commit each one individually
once its own pipeline step(s) are green — never apply multiple patches in one uncommitted batch, even if they
all came from this same report.
